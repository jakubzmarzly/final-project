# Final Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors!
# This application runs a game of rock, paper, scissors on a webpage hosted on Azure. The player plays against a computer, and the first to 5 wins is victorious.

# My final project incorporated most of the basic features I was hoping to include in the application. If I had more time, I would have added multiple game modes, and more objects in addition to rock, paper, and scissors.
